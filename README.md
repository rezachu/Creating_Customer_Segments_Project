# Creating Customer Segments

## Overview
This is the third official project of the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree, and the course is co-created with Kaggle. In this project, we are going to build an unsupervised learning model to predict the customer segments. The objective is to learn about the basic concepts of unsupervised learning and have a implementation practice on it.


## Software requirement

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

## Documents included in the repository

- `README.md`
- `customers.csv`
- `customer_segments.html`
- `customer_segments.ipynb`
- `renders.py`

### Memo to Python beginner
In case you are new to Python and you do not know how to create an environment and install the package, here are few links that could help.
- [Managing Python](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/py2or3.html)
- [Managing Environments](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html)
- [Create Virtual Environments for Python with Conda](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/)

## Run 
1. Start your the terminal or command line
2. Activate your environment
3. Navigate to the root directory of this repository (./Creating_Customer_Segments_Project/)
4. Run `jupyter notebook customer_segments.ipynb`

Then the web browser would open the jupyter notebook.


## Data

The dataset used in this project is included as `customers.csv`. You can find more information on this dataset on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers) page.
